   test dual stack networking

access via web browser( http)
use both ipv6 , ipv4 to get data from server


request from client's browser [::ffff:192.168.0.97]:8080
or 192.168.0.97


Note:
1. should scan all interface avaliable ( IP , interface) 
to use bind on suitable

2. from now implement ipv6 to it can support dual stack for own application

3. need investigate response of HTTP message more
